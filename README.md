# PawedExtensions

We do not own any of these extensions, all of them come from https://github.com/TurboWarp/extensions/pulls.

If the file does not have a license at the top of the file it is assumed to be MIT (see contributing.md on the extension repo), if it does have a license a copy will be provided to you.
